# lchang06.github.io

I have implemented my personal home page accessed by https://lchang06.github.io or http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~lchang06, containing my name and photo. In addition on this home page, there is a link to my resume and a short bio about me.

I collaborated with the TA Michael who helped explain the difference between the index.html file on my Tufts server vs. the index.html file on my local computer.

I have spent approximately 3.5 hours on this assignment.
