<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm Lena! I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and moved out to Massachussets for college. Currently, I am a student at Tufts University majoring in Human Factors Engineering (AKA Engineering Psychology) and minoring in Studio Art. I also work as a Research Assistant at the Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences.</p>

<p>In my free time, you can find me eating and exploring coffee shops around town, hiking, re-learning Chinese, reading, or playing the piano.</p>
