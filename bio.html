<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm Lena, a student at Tufts University majoring in Human Factors Engineering (AKA Engineering Psychology) and minoring in Studio Art. I also work as a Research Assistant at the Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I love problem-solving through human-centered design with the goal of connecting people to products that add positive experiences to their lives.</p>

<p>In my free time, you can find me eating, hiking, re-learning Chinese, reading, or playing the piano.</p>
